    <hr>
    This web page is an example using JSP and BEANs.
    <p>
        Guess my favorite two colors

    <p> If you fail to guess both of them - you get yellow on red.

    <p> If you guess one of them right, either your foreground or
        your background will change to the color that was guessed right.

    <p> Guess them both right and your browser foreground/background
        will change to my two favorite colors to display this page.
